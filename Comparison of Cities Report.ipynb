    "The New York metropolitan area is one of the world's most populous megacities with more than 8 million residents. The large population and high population density (27,751/sq mi) offers a huge market for wide range of businesses. Moreover, the iconic New York City Subway system is the largest rapid transit system in the world. This subway system is widely used by New Yorkers.\n",

    "NYC Foods is planning to set up a network of food trucks across NYC. They plan to capitalise on the high population and robust Subway network of the city. They plan to set up the food trucks near subway stations, and provide low cost fast food to busy subway users. The eventual plan is to have food trucks all across NYC. But to begin with they have decided to start in the borough of The Bronx."

    "Our client NYC Foods has entrusted us with the project of narrowing down on the most suitable subway stations in The Bronx, where they can put up the first set of food trucks. The best stations will be the ones with low concentration of other food trucks, food stalls or fast food joints near the station as these are our client's direct competitors. The presence of restaurants, diners etc. does not matter as our client's target customers are those who prefer fast food at low cost. So, we need to use data and cluster the subway stations in The Bronx based on the concentration of our client's competitors near the station."
